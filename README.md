### Abstract
Vanilla Temporal Pooling is an unsupervised temporal feature learning method, which can effectively capture the temporal dynamics for an entire audio signal with arbitrary duration by building direct connections between the BoAW histograms sequence and its time indexes using a non-linear Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. Furthermore, to make the feature representation have a better signal reconstruction ability, we embedded the sparse coding approach in the conventional BoAW framework.
